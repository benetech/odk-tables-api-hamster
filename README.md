# Open Data Kit Tables Sync API (for Hamster)

This is the odk-tables-api jar, separated out from the [original ODK Aggregate](https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate) project for use with ODK Hamster.

You could use it in client projects that you would like to talk to [ODK Hamster](https://github.com/benetech/odk-hamster).
